    "text": "President Vlodymyr Zelensky warned on Wednesday that \u0027millions\u0027 of Ukrainians could die if NATO and the West wait for World War Three to start before imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine to stop Vladimir Putin\u0027s bombing campaign.  \r\n\r\nHe also warned that Russia wants Ukrainians to \u0027feel like animals\u0027 as he urged NATO and the West to act two weeks after Moscow launched an all-out invasion of his homeland - and added that Putin is \u0027going directly to hell\u0027. \r\n\r\n\u0027They want us to feel like animals because they blocked our cities, the biggest cities in Ukraine and they blocked them because they don\u0027t want our people to get some food or water,\u0027 he said in an interview with Sky News. \r\n\r\n\u0027We can\u0027t stop all of this alone. Only if the world will unite around Ukraine.\r\n\r\n\u0027Don\u0027t wait for me to ask you several times, a million times, to close the sky. You have to phone us, to our people who lost their children, and say \u0027\u0027sorry we didn\u0027t do it yesterday\u0027. \r\n\r\n\u0027The world did nothing. I\u0027m sorry, but it\u0027s true. In future, it will be too late. They will close the sky but will lose millions of people [while they wait]\u0027. \r\n\r\nWestern governments have so far baulked at Zelensky\u0027s increasingly desperate appeal for a no-fly zone to be declared over Ukraine, fearing it would trigger a conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, underscoring Western support, Britain said it was preparing to send more portable missile systems to help Ukraine, in addition to more than 3,000 anti-tank weapons sent so far.\r\n\r\nAnd Canada\u0027s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised an additional $50 million worth of military equipment.\r\n\r\nThe International Monetary Fund approved a $1.4 billion emergency package for Kyiv to provide \u0027critical financial support.\u0027 \r\n\r\nZelensky\u0027s comments came after a maternity hospital in the city of Mariupol was decimated in a \u0027direct hit\u0027 by Russian rockets on Wednesday afternoon, which left children buried in the rubble.   \r\n\r\nFootage has emerged of badly wounded patients and nurses being evacuated from decimated buildings, while pregnant women were carried out on stretchers into a courtyard covered in rubble and littered with huge craters.   \r\n\r\nAt least 17 people, including women in labour, were injured in the attack, officials said.\r\n\r\nAn official death toll for the heinous attack has not yet been established but rescuers are working desperately to find and free those still trapped under the rubble with temperatures in the besieged city set to plunge to minus 4 degrees C overnight. \r\n\r\nZelensky himself posted a video showing the badly damaged hospital buildings, filmed inside a destroyed ward room with its windows blown out and ceiling partially collapsed. \r\n\r\nMore footage showed a car park covered in rubble and the smouldering wrecks of vehicles as injured families staggered into the freezing air while snow fell. \r\n\r\n\u0027Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity,\u0027 the President tweeted.",

This is a disgrace for the International Paralympic Committee,\" said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters following the decision.\r\nRussian tanks emblazoned with \u0026#39;Z\u0026#39; were first spotted on Ukraine\u0026#39;s border.

Here\u0027s how the letter became a pro-war symbol\r\nThe IOC also announced that it had withdrawn the Olympic Order -- the highest award of the Olympic movement -- from Putin.\r\n\"The IOC was viewed as having a close relationship with Russia,\" Michael Payne, former head of marketing at the IOC, told CNN.\r\n\"The fact that the IOC has now issued a set of sanctions to Russia, which, in my view, are probably the strongest sanctions the IOC has ever issued ... since probably the early 60s when the IOC banned South Africa for its apartheid regime,\" he said.\r\nMeanwhile, world football\u0027s governing body, FIFA, and European soccer body, UEFA, have suspended all Russian international and club teams from their competitions \"until further notice.\"",

    "text": "\u003cp\u003e(CNN)Goodbye San Siro, hello \u0027The Cathedral\u0027 -- AC Milan and Internazionale have revealed designs for their new shared home. One of football\u0027s most historic arenas and the largest stadium in Italy, the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza -- commonly known as the San Siro -- has been a shared residence of the two Serie A giants since 1947, but will make way for a new sport and leisure district. \u0027The Cathedral\u0027 will form the center-piece of a 275,000 square-meter district, and will be developed by Populous -- the architectural firm\u0027s design selected by the two clubs. Populous has worked on several of the sport\u0027s largest venues, including Wembley Stadium, Arsenal\u0027s Emirates Stadium and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, as well as Sporting Lisbon\u0027s Estadio Da Luz. The firm also designed the flagship stadiums for the Olympic Games in Sydney 2000 and London 2012, in addition to New York\u0027s Yankee Stadium and Seattle\u0027s Climate Pledge Arena in the US. A move-in date is envsiaged for 2027 -- with plans in place to host the 2026 Winter Olympic Games opening ceremony at the San Siro -- according to Italy\u0027s La Gazetto dello Sport, who added the new stadium would have a 65,000 capacity. The San Siro currently has a 80,000 capacity. \u0027the most beautiful stadium in the world\u0027 The new stadium\u0027s design is \"a celebration of the artistic and cultural heritage of Milan\", said the two clubs and draws inspiration from two of the city\u0027s most iconic buildings -- the Duomo di Milano (the city\u0027s cathedral) and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, a 19th century shopping arcade. Set to be carbon neutral, the stadium will be surrounded by a 50,000 square-meter green arena, with \"most\" of the district\u0027s sport and leisure activities to be free of charge or affiliated with the city of Milan.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "text": "Two years ago, the calamitous first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic hit the US with unprecedented intensity. The depth of the terror can be difficult to recall and, thanks to advances in diagnosis, treatment and vaccination, is unlikely to recur. For scientists, however, it is crucial to revisit the dark time and rethink what happened by examining the almost endless data that was collected to try to better understand both the immediate and the long-term effects this disease has on the body.\r\n\r\nBecause so many deaths were due to respiratory failure, many colleagues I talked with expected to find progressive pneumonia with lung destruction as the cause. However, researchers discovered something entirely different: blood clots in the lungs (also referred to as pulmonary emboli). Furthermore, they found countless additional smaller clots in many other organs as well. (Note that experts distinguish between clot and thrombus and embolus but for simplicity, we\u0027ll call them all clots.)\r\n\r\nThese findings are particularly topical now, following an important article just published in Nature Medicine. Researchers utilized the vast databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to examine more than 150,000 people who had survived Covid-19 infections and compared them with millions of people in the VA database who were similar in age, sex and other features but who did not develop Covid-19.\r\nImportantly, they looked at overall health not just in the immediate aftermath of the infection, but an entire year after Covid-19. (The researchers estimated the \"post-Covid year\" timeframe among those not actually infected using statistical methods.) Investigators included Covid-19 survivors who were never hospitalized (131,612 people), in addition to those who recovered after staying in the intensive care unit (5,388 people) or regular hospital ward (16,760 people).\r\nThe results are clear and very significant: Compared with similar people who had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2, those who recovered from infection had many more blood clots, heart problems and strokes. The extent of the differences across the 20 different cardiovascular conditions is among the greatest of any clinical study I have read. It is jaw-dropping.\r\nThe chaos from Omicron might be fading, but the turbulence ahead could be worse\r\nThe chaos from Omicron might be fading, but the turbulence ahead could be worse\r\nThe study is telling us something we don\u0027t particularly want to hear, but that is a critical piece of information for many reasons. First, it will help those trying to understand long Covid; second, it can help direct prevention and treatment decisions for those with active Covid-19 as well as those who survived the disease; and finally, it likely will contribute to an improved understanding of the very complicated dance of clotting and anti-clotting that goes on within each of our bodies every day.\r\nThe VA study has important limitations. It involves people infected in 2020 who are at least a year post-infection; these people likely had the initial \"wild\" strain of SARS-CoV-2 or perhaps the Alpha variant, which dominated in late 2020. Not enough time has passed to know if similar long-term dysfunctions of the blood vessels and heart also will occur among survivors of Delta or Omicron variant infections. And the study cannot predict the health impact of Covid-19 two and three and 10 years after recovery.\r\nIndeed, this last issue may be the most pressing. No one knows how long the cardiovascular abnormalities will persist or if they will resolve at all. Advising this very large group of people who recovered from Covid-19 and may have lingering health issues is therefore a murky business. Should each find a cardiologist? A blood clotting specialist? Will long-term Covid-19 management become a new subspecialty similar to the not-so-long-ago emergence of the AIDS specialist?\r\nIt is altogether uncertain what comes next, but the fact that almost 80 million Americans have been infected makes a cohesive plan for their health care a necessity. Experts will draw up basic guidelines to help patients know the best path forward. Though, once again similar to the field of AIDS medicine, much will be done by trial and error as some people will be followed too intensely and others not intensely enough. Over time, a crisp and simple \"if this, then that\" sensible approach will likely emerge.\r\nIt would be nice to think that this sort of information would be powerful to convince people still unwilling to receive the Covid-19 vaccine or the booster shot by providing simple and horrifying truths about the aftermath of the disease.

And many of those include myths around the Covid-19 vaccine, so we\u0027ve seen firsthand how misinformation is harming people\u0027s health when it comes to Covid.\"\r\n\r\nThis marks the first time the administration has called on tech companies to share certain data publicly, including data on the major sources of misinformation, how widespread it is and who may have been targeted more than others.\r\n\r\nThe focus has been on reaching out to tech companies with the broadest reach and use, Murthy said, and he wants them to be more transparent and open about sharing data with the public.\r\n\"We\u0027ll be looking forward to whatever information they have to share. We\u0027re certainly approaching this with an open mind,\" he said. \"Many of the new technology platforms have also been talking about solutions that they are trying to implement, but what we want to understand is what data do they have on whether these solutions are actually working or not.\"\r\nTwitter tests option for users to report \u0026#39;misleading\u0026#39; tweets to crack down on misinformation\r\nTwitter tests option for users to report \u0027misleading\u0027 tweets to crack down on misinformation\r\nHe said the information will also help public health researchers who, for too long, have not been able to successfully gather data about the impact of health misinformation found on the platforms.\r\nStories about misinformation from health care workers, teachers and families are equally important, Murthy said.\r\n\"Health misinformation is making the jobs of health care workers much harder at a time where our health care work force is strained,\" he said. \"I hear from health care workers that they are battling Covid in the hospitals during the day, and they\u0027re going home and battling health misinformation at night.\"\r\nUltimately, the information will be shared with the public and used to steer responses to future public health emergencies.\r\nA nurse\u0026#39;s training didn\u0026#39;t protect her from vaccine misinformation.

Hong Kong -- once lauded as a zero-Covid success story -- is now battling a deadly outbreak reminiscent of the early days of the pandemic, despite having had more than two years to prepare.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWith locally transmitted cases surging past 312,000 in the city of 7.4 million in just the last two weeks, hospitals and embattled health workers have been stretched to breaking point. The numbers are likely to be far higher due to suspicions people are not reporting their positive test results for fear of being separated from families and put into government isolation facilities. Although the rampant surge has been driven by the less deadly Omicron variant, Hong Kong\u0027s deaths are also rising -- particularly among the city\u0027s unvaccinated elderly. According to Our World in Data, which uses data from Johns Hopkins University, Hong Kong reported more deaths per million people in the week to March 3 than any country or territory. The city\u0027s leader Carrie Lam said the city is facing an \"unprecedented challenge\" and insists nobody could have predicted the latest wave. But according to Hong Kong University clinical virologist Siddharth Sridhar, the situation was a \"predictable and preventable disaster.\" For two years, as the pandemic raged around the world, Hong Kong largely contained the virus, and there was a growing feeling the city might keep the virus out forever. As cases rose this year, the government reimposed its strictest rules, limiting public gatherings to two, closing restaurants and bars after 6 p.m., and roping off public playgrounds.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut it still wasn\u0027t enough. With few other levers to pull, the government plans to launch a mandatory mass testing drive in an attempt to purge the city of Covid. Schools will break for summer early and be repurposed as isolation, testing and vaccination facilities. And it\u0027s still unclear whether a citywide lockdown is on the cards. \"March is going to be a very, very difficult time,\" said Sridhar. \"(It\u0027s) definitely an unprecedented health crisis for Hong Kong.\" For a city that has already put up with two years of tough restrictions, news of citywide testing has proved too much for some residents who are frantically looking for a flight out. And while vaccines mean Hong Kong is better off than it would have been two years ago, immunization rates are still lagging among its elderly population -- meaning many of the city\u0027s most vulnerable are still unprotected.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "text": "Karim Benzema might be on his way out of the Bernabeu if Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland arrive in the summer, but on this evidence he is going to make life hard for anyone who challenges for his spot, and for the manager and owner of the club to sanction his departure. He has one more year left on his contract, but another extension cannot be ruled out.\r\nKarim Benzema’s future at Real Madrid might be put in danger by the arrival of Kylian Mbappe this summer, but he demonstrated once again why he remains essential to his team.\r\nThere was chatter in the press before kick-off that were Real to lose on Wednesday night, they would act swiftly to arrange and announce a formal agreement with the Paris Saint-Germain forward, but those talks will now be put on hold. We can expect that a deal will still be agreed in the coming weeks or months, but the urgency has been reduced following the French side’s astonishing collapse, and the 34-year-old striker’s incredible contribution.\r\nIn the early stages of the second leg, both the former Barcelona players impressed alongside Leandro Paredes, but it was Mbappe who dominated even before his first half goal. Mbappe stretched his rivals, he whistled past them at speed, and he toyed with them from a distance.\r\nHis goal demonstrated many, but far from all, of his qualities. Neymar pounced expertly to release his colleague down the inside left, but the 22-year-old showed remarkable poise to carry the ball at speed and then have the presence of mind to deceive Thibaut Courtois in goal, sending him the wrong way in a one-on-one. Not only did he send Courtois the wrong way, but he used the motion of the ball alone to construct a feint that was as artful as it was well-time\r\nWhile Messi still retains deft touches and genius in his boots, Mbappe is growing into his abilities, and conceivably is the next player who we can expect to deliver at least a goal every game, and it is clear while Real Madrid president Florentino Perez regards him as the key signing to usher in a new era. Here is a marketable, brilliant, young and improving player who is already the leader at his current side.\r\nBut Benzema demonstrated everything you would want from a senior striker. When it looked as if his side were going out of the tournament, it was the Frenchman who chased down Gianluigi Donnarumma, forced a mistake, and was able to give his teammates a glimmer of hope - that was enough to set them on their way.",

    "text": " (CNN)HBO Max has developed a fondness for reunions after that awkward \"Friends\" gathering and \"The West Wing\" voting special. Yet \"Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts\" strikes just the right balance, looking back at the cinematic franchise with warmth and humor, while delicately capturing the impact on kids raised on a movie set over a formative decade.\r\nPerhaps foremost, this 100-odd-minute documentary -- shrewdly divided into four chapters, each encompassing two movies -- makes terrific use of clips and outtakes to illustrate its anecdotes and remembrances. When Emma Watson and Rupert Grint discuss the uncomfortable buildup to Hermione and Ron\u0027s first kiss, it\u0027s presented not just with the actual scene but footage of them fidgeting and laughing while trying to shoot it, as well as director David Yates discussing his efforts to guide them.\r\nTears flow before it\u0027s over, but the unavoidable sentimentality of it all feels mostly earned, especially when acknowledging those featured in the films who have died, among them Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and most recently Helen McCrory.\r\n\r\nAs for another big name, J.K. Rowling, the producers have managed to incorporate the author -- who has stirred controversy with her commentary about gender identity and trans rights -- with material culled from a 2019 interview. It\u0027s a bit of magic all its own, really, acknowledging Rowling\u0027s contribution without fully inviting her to the party. (Daniel Radcliffe was among those who publicly responded to Rowling\u0027s statements.)\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the special begins by recalling the enormous popularity of the books and the search for the kids, with Radcliffe describing himself as a happy child \"with a really haunted quality,\" precisely what director Chris Columbus was seeking in the title role.\r\nIn hindsight, the remarkable aspect of the \"Harry Potter\" franchise emanated from the audacity of casting young actors who would provide its foundation across eight movies, then surrounding them with what\u0027s accurately described as \"British royalty of the acting world,\" several of whom take part, including Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Isaacs, and Gary Oldman. (Seeing Fiennes\u0027 performance before his nose is digitally removed offers one of the more fascinating behind-the-scenes treats.)\r\nEmma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint (center foreground) in the HBO Max special \u0026#39;Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts.\u0026#39;\r\nEmma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint (center foreground) in the HBO Max special \u0027Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts.\u0027\r\nTom Felton, who portrayed Draco Malfoy, amusingly confesses to first seeing all these acclaimed actors and \"not having a clue who anyone is.\" In other cases, the kids admit to being starstruck, whereas their elders and the directors discuss the strategies they employed dealing with a set filled with children, including the onset of \"teenage hormones\" and related crushes in the middle of the series.\r\nWhile not entirely intentional, executive producer Casey Patterson and his team have simultaneously created a document not just to the making of the movies, but the broader issues faced by children working as actors. Watson, for example, acknowledges having thought about quitting about halfway through, saying, \"The fame thing, it finally hit home in a big way.\"\r\nIn other words, even with all the precautions taken to foster a nurturing environment for the children -- something the central trio, their peers and filmmakers address at some length -- they couldn\u0027t be entirely shielded from the effects of such daunting attention at an early age, caught up as they were in the center of a multi-billion-dollar enterprise.\r\nIn its most emotional moments, the younger actors express the nature of the bond forged among them in this artificial world. While one suspects there\u0027s a bit of performing in staging the on-camera reunions, those moments feel genuine enough regarding how they supported each other through this extraordinary time. (As a footnote, the special also offers a reminder of the brilliance of John Williams\u0027 musical score.)\r\n\r\nOverall, \"Return to Hogwarts\" is perhaps more magic-filled than consistently magical. But when the special gets it right, streaming\u0027s latest trip down memory lane not only provides inspiration to go re-watch these movies, but it does cast a certain kind of spell unlike most Hollywood-orchestrated reunions by conjuring a touching sense of the shared experience that these boys and girls lived.\r\n\"Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts\" premieres Jan. 1 on HBO Max. Like CNN, Warner Bros. and HBO Max are units of WarnerMedia.",

    "text": "Russia has confirmed its use of thermobaric vacuum bombs in Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence in London said last night.\r\n\r\nThe TOS-1A weapon system had been deployed and its impact had been “devastating”, a British intelligence update said. The armoured multiple rocket launcher, which was used by Russian forces in Afghanistan and Chechnya, fires thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects.\r\n\r\nThe use of the weapons is not illegal but is strictly regulated by the laws of armed conflict. The weapons comprise a fuel container and two charges, the first detonating to disperse the fuel and the second igniting it in the air, resulting in a blast wave and heat that create a vacuum. This makes it deadly for people in an enclosed space.\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "A new spy-in-the-sky camera which identified 15,000 cases of drivers using mobile phones could also catch motorists eating, drinking, or not wearing a seatbelt, its makers say.  \r\n\r\nSmart cameras linked to a new, automated system using artificial intelligence (AI) are being trialled on an undisclosed motorway - ahead of a blanket ban on holding a mobile device while driving which comes into force in early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe cameras instantly analyse high-definition photos taken through the windscreen of passing cars, and Jenoptik, the enforcement technology firm testing the cameras in the UK, believes they will be crucial in providing evidence to prosecute offenders.\r\n\r\nThe pilot scheme has been running since spring and it is hoped a wider rollout across the country will be possible next year.\r\n\r\nBut Acusensus, the Australian firm who designed the cameras, admits that they can be used to catch motorists doing anything from eating, drinking, smoking, adjusting the radio or using navigation devices in a holder.\r\n\r\nThe company says in a brochure that the system \u0027addresses all forms of distraction, beyond the illegal use of mobile phones\u0027.    \r\n\r\nThe technology, which can also catch drivers not wearing a seatbelt, is already used in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, where it is estimated to have reduced road fatalities by a fifth since it was introduced two years ago.  \r\n\r\nBut local reports reveal that a bungled rollout of the mobile speed cameras in NSW resulted in drivers in the south of the state avoiding fines, while those in the north were caught out. \r\n\r\nThe state government blamed Acusensus, which was awarded a $77million (£41million) contract to operate the cameras in southern NSW, for not being able to buy enough vehicles due to the impact of coronavirus, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.\r\nA driver is caught on camera using their mobile phone while driving on the motorway\r\n\r\nA driver is caught on camera using their mobile phone while driving on the motorway\r\nThe technology, which can also catch drivers not wearing a seatbelt, is already used in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, where it is estimated to have reduced road fatalities by a fifth since it was introduced two years ago\r\n\r\nThe technology, which can also catch drivers not wearing a seatbelt, is already used in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, where it is estimated to have reduced road fatalities by a fifth since it was introduced two years ago\r\nThe company says in a brochure that the system \u0027addresses all forms of distraction, beyond the illegal use of mobile phones\u0027\r\n\r\nThe company says in a brochure that the system \u0027addresses all forms of distraction, beyond the illegal use of mobile phones\u0027\r\n\r\nAcusensus, the Australian firm who designed the cameras, admits that they can be used to catch motorists doing anything from eating, drinking, smoking, adjusting the radio or using navigation devices in a holder. The company says in a brochure that the system \u0027addresses all forms of distraction, beyond the illegal use of mobile phones\u0027\r\n\r\nBut fine revenue from the government\u0027s mobile speed camera program had risen to $23.7million (£12.7million) in the year leading up to June - ten times the $2.3million (£1.24million) in the previous period. \r\n\r\nFigures revealed that the top 100 locations for mobile speed camera fines in July were in the north, while zero tickets were issued in Wagga Wagga and Queanbeyan in July - down from 339 and 152 respectively in the prior month. \r\n\r\nThe roads spokesman for the country\u0027s Labor Party, John Graham, said Acusensus\u0027s failure to deliver led to a \u0027major inequity\u0027, with a record number of fines in the north of the state - but nearly zero in the south. \r\n\r\nThose in the UK who were identified in the trial have not been penalised as the trial is a \u0027proof of concept\u0027.\r\n\r\nThe cameras – which can be fixed to overhead gantries or fitted in portable trailers – use very high shutter speeds to take pictures through the windscreens of each passing vehicle.\r\n\r\nHigh-definition images are produced in any weather and at speeds of up to 185mph without any motion blur. \r\n\r\nNew high-tech cameras can instantly capture motorists calling, texting or scrolling at the wheel, as is pictured above\r\n\r\nThe new cameras that take pictures through car windscreens of drivers using their phones at the wheel\r\n\r\nThe new cameras that take pictures through car windscreens of drivers using their phones at the wheel\r\n\r\nSophisticated software sifts through each image in real time and flags anyone deemed to be breaking the law to a team of human moderators to review.\r\n\r\nIf use of the cameras is approved by law, the images would be sent to police and notices of intended prosecution posted to the vehicle\u0027s owner in the same way as speeding penalties.\r\n\r\nIn November the UK Government announced that motorists would be banned from picking up their mobiles for any reason while driving from next year.\r\n\r\nOffenders will face a fine of up to £200 and six points on their licence. It is designed to close a loophole in the current law that means drivers can be prosecuted only if they are caught using hand-held phones to call or text.  \r\n\r\nOne in four drivers admitted using a phone in their hand while driving at least once in the past 12 months, according to a survey by the Department for Transport.\r\n\r\nIf a driver looks at their phone for two seconds while travelling at 30mph, they will travel 100ft blind.",

    "text": "In public statements and at international summits, Chinese officials have attempted to stake out a seemingly neutral position on the war in Ukraine, neither condemning Russian actions nor ruling out the possibility Beijing could act as a mediator in a push for peace.\r\nBut while its international messaging has kept many guessing as to Beijing\u0027s true intentions, much of its domestic media coverage of Russia\u0027s invasion tells a wholly different story.\r\nThere, an alternate reality is playing out for China\u0027s 1.4 billion people, one in which the invasion is nothing more than a \"special military operation,\" according to its national broadcaster CCTV; the United States may be funding a biological weapons program in Ukraine, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is a victim standing up for a beleaguered Russia.\r\nTo tell that story, major state-run news media outlets -- which dominate China\u0027s highly censored media space -- have been largely echoing Russian state media stories or information from Russian officials.\r\nA CNN analysis reviewed nearly 5,000 social media posts from 14 Chinese state media outlets during the first eight days of Russia\u0027s invasion posted onto China\u0027s Twitter-like platform, Weibo. The analysis found that of the more than 300 most-shared posts about the events in Ukraine -- which were each shared more than 1,000 times -- almost half, about 140, were what CNN classified as distinctly pro-Russian, often containing information attributed to a Russian official or picked up directly from Russia\u0027s state media.\r\nThe analysis, which focused on stories that got the most play on social media, may not be representative of all posts shared by state media outlets on Weibo. But it provides a snapshot of the state media-produced information that is most visible to the more than half a billion monthly users on the popular platform.\r\nIt\u0027s not clear the extent to which these posts may be explicitly the result of a coordinated propaganda campaign between the two countries, but it is consistent with an ongoing pattern in which Russian and Chinese media have amplified and reinforced their often-interchangeable talking points on issues such as the treatment of Russian dissidents, Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, or the supposed American role in fomenting \"color revolutions\" against authoritarian regimes.

    "text": "\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eMore than a century after it sank off the coast of Antarctica, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton\u0027s ship HMS Endurance has been located, apparently intact and in good condition. The ship, which sank in 1915, is 3,008 meters (1.9 miles or 9,842 feet) deep in the Weddell Sea, a pocket in the Southern Ocean along the northern coast of Antarctica, south of the Falkland Islands. The discovery was a collaboration between the Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust and History Hit, the content platform co-founded by historian Dan Snow. \"This is by far the finest wooden shipwreck I have ever seen. It is upright, well proud of the seabed, intact, and in a brilliant state of preservation,\" Mensun Bound, the mission\u0027s director of exploration, said in a statement. He added: \"This is a milestone in polar history.\" Irish-British explorer Shackleton had a longtime obsession with the South Pole and set off on a total of four expeditions toward the White Continent. Endurance departed from the UK in 1914 and reached Antarctica\u0027s McMurdo Sound the following year on a journey called the the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. However, due to the extreme conditions, the ship got stuck amid thick, impenetrable ice in the Weddell Sea. The 28 men on board, including Shackleton himself, abandoned the Endurance and set up rudimentary camp facilities on board ice floes that were floating northward. Eventually, the team made it to the uninhabited Elephant Island, then some -- including Shackleton -- volunteered to get in a lifeboat and head toward South Georgia Island, finally crossing it on foot to reach Stromness whaling station, which was then manned by the Norwegians, and organize a rescue of the men left behind on Elephant Island.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the expedition was a failure, the team\u0027s survival and eventual rescue months later, without any loss of life, was seen as a triumph of their tenacity and the incredible leadership skills of Shackleton. Following another expedition later in his life, Shackleton died on South Georgia Island in 1922, at the age of 47, and is buried there. After being abandoned, Endurance eventually sank into the Weddell Sea, where she has been ever since. Its resting place is about four miles south of where Captain Frank Worsley, a New Zealander who helmed the ship, had believed it to be. Director of exploration Bound said that Worsley\u0027s navigational records proved \"invaluable\" in locating the ship. The discovery team departed from Cape Town on the South African polar research and logistics vessel, S.A. Agulhas II. Fittingly, they dubbed their ship -- and mission -- Endurance22.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "text": "Obi-Wan Kenobi is set to premiere on May 25th, exactly forty-five years since the first time the titular character appeared on our scenes as portrayed by Alec Guinness in Star Wars: A New Hope. Now, he\u0027s back, with Ewan McGregor once again stepping into the role he portrayed during the Prequel era, and it\u0027s safe to say that no one is prepared for what Lucasfilm has planned for us.\r\n\r\nThe limited series is set to take place ten years after the tragic events of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, where Obi-Wan Kenobi was dealt with his greatest defeat when his closest friend and Jedi apprentice, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) fell to the dark side. Expectations are high that we might also get a glimpse of the duo back before Anakin\u0027s fall when they were allies working alongside each other in the Jedi Order.\r\n\r\nIn the trailer we see Obi-Wan Kenobi keeping a watchful eye on a young Luke Skywalker, the Grand Inquisitor\u0027s hunt for Obi-Wan Kenobi and the remaining Jedi, and the rise of the Empire set to the backdrop of John Williams\u0027 soul-stirring \"Duel of Fates.\"\r\n\r\nDeborah Chow made her Star Wars debut with Chapter 3 of The Mandalorian, and now she\u0027s back showrunning and directing the Obi-Wan Kenobi series, which was penned by Joby Harold. It will be exciting to see what Chow can do with the series, especially since this will be the first Star Wars live-action series that will be written by one screenwriter and directed by a singular director. It will certainly allow for one cohesive creative vision. And based on the trailer, she\u0027s getting ready to unleash a truly incredible series.\r\nIn addition to McGregor and Christensen, Obi-Wan Kenobi marks the return of Joel Edgerton and Bonnie Piesse who played Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru in the final act of the Prequel trilogy. In the newly released Entertainment Weekly issue, it was revealed that Moses Ingram will portray a force-sensitive Inquisitor named Reva who is tracking down Obi-Wan Kenobi. The series is also set to introduce a new slate of characters, though a few could theoretically be portraying characters previously seen in the Star Wars canon, though nothing is confirmed yet. The cast list includes Kumail Nanjiani, Indira Varma, Rupert Friend, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Sung Kang, Simone Kessell, and Benny Safdie.\r\n\r\nThe limited series is executive produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Michelle Rejwan, Deborah Chow, Ewan McGregor, and Joby Harold.\r\n\r\nObi-Wan Kenobi will premiere exclusively on Disney+ on May 25th, 2022. Check out the first trailer below:",

    "text": "You\u0027re ready to swap your old cloth masks for N95s as some experts recommend, but the higher price tag and two little words -- \"single use\" -- are giving you pause. How long can you really wear an N95 and still protect yourself and others from Covid-19 risk?\r\nAn N95 mask\u0027s material and filtration ability aren\u0027t \"going to degrade unless you physically rub it or poke holes in it,\" Marr said. \"You\u0027d have to be in really polluted air ... for several days before it lost its ability to filter out particles. So, you can really wear them for a long time.\r\n\r\n\"People have been talking about 40 hours -- I think that\u0027s fine. Really, it\u0027s going to get gross from your face or the straps will get too loose or maybe break before you\u0027re going to lose filtration ability,\" she added.\r\nThe reason why N95 masks are designated as single use is because they\u0027re categorized as medical masks, said Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.\r\nIn medical settings, health care workers change masks more frequently to avoid \"cross-contaminating a patient room with equipment that was worn in a room of an infectious person and then moving to the next room and bringing that infection with you,\" he said. \"When you then take a medical-grade thing that\u0027s single-use and put it in the general public, we\u0027re not worried about you cross-contaminating different environments you\u0027re being in. It\u0027s really about providing protection to you.\"\r\nN95s \"used to be only $1 or so each,\" Bromage added, but prices have recently spiked as public demand for these masks has increased amid Omicron variant concerns. If you safely reuse N95s, you\u0027re getting at least two or three days of use from one mask, Bromage added, but \"I realize that it still adds up to an expense.\"\r\nSome local public health departments, such as the Maryland and Milwaukee health departments, are offering free N95 masks.\r\nHere\u0027s what else you should know about safely wearing and reusing N95 masks.\r\nWhy N95s?\r\nCompared to cloth masks, properly fitted N95s better prevent tiny particles from getting into your nose or mouth thanks to certain materials -- such as polypropylene fibers -- acting as both mechanical and electrostatic barriers to shared air, the primary driver of coronavirus infection.\r\nThe difference between N95 and KN95 masks is where the mask is certified, according to Oklahoma\u0027s state health department. The US certifies N95s, whereas China approves KN95s. Around 60% of KN95 respirators sold in the US are counterfeit and don\u0027t meet the requirements of the National Institute for Occupational Health \u0026 Safety, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\n\"If you see an N95 as marketed for children, that should raise a red flag,\" Marr added. \"There will be KN95 and KF94s that are designed for and marketed for children. With those, it\u0027s the same issue as we discussed for adults, which is to make sure you\u0027re getting them from a trusted, reputable source, because there\u0027s a problem with fake KN95s that are not nearly as protective as they should be.\"\r\nProject N95, the National Clearinghouse working to provide equitable access to personal protective equipment and coronavirus tests, is a reputable source for N95 and KN95 masks, Marr said.\r\nKF94s are Korean-standard masks.",

He produced and starred in two hit films, \"Jungle Cruise\" and \"Red Notice,\" debuted his biographical sitcom \"Young Rock,\" saw unprecedented sales growth with his Teremana tequila, and became the most followed American man on Instagram with 285 million followers. At 49, with grit, charisma and determination to \"deliver the goods,\" Johnson has segued from professional wrestler to movie star, major entrepreneur and someone nearly half of America would like to see as the next president of the United States, according to one poll. CNN spoke with Johnson this week about his monumental year. He addressed hype around his possible return to the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise and his potential political ambitions. He also offered a glimpse at how he plans to top his blockbuster 2021. Our conversation, which has been lightly edited for flow and clarity, follows below. You\u0027ve seen some great successes, any highlights? Reflecting back, anything you wish you would have done differently? \"I worked hard, had some luck on my side and was able to accomplish a few things in 2021. A few highlights that come to mind, one would be completing two massive Seven Bucks Productions films, \u0027Red Notice\u0027 and \u0027Black Adam.\u0027 (Set for release in 2022.) Both presented a lot of challenges during Covid, but like so many businesses out there, we adjust, get clarity, create our new Covid strategy and get to work. Seven Bucks also just completed -- two weeks ago -- our second season of NBC\u0027s \u0027Young Rock.\u0027 I\u0027m quite proud of everyone\u0027s efforts and talents to get the job done and deliver quality.

As for anything I would\u0027ve done differently in 2021, sure, I would\u0027ve listened to my gut when it was telling me to slow down a bit. Enjoy these moments even more with your family and friends, because at the end of the day these joyful moments are the s*** that really matters in life. Sorry to cuss but that\u0027s the truth. Good lesson to always listen to that voice in your gut.\" Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot in \"Red Notice.\" Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot in \"Red Notice.\" \"Red Notice\" received an enormous amount of praise, from both those in the industry and with audiences worldwide by becoming Netflix\u0027s most watched movie in the world for 2021, and most watched of all time. What do you think made \"Red Notice\" so successful? \"First thing, we made a great movie for families around the world to enjoy. That\u0027s the bottom line. Deliver the goods. I always say I can bring people to the dance and with the trust they have in me, they\u0027ll dance one song. But then it\u0027s up to the quality I\u0027m offering that will make them dance all night. We made a great movie and people are dancing to it. Rawson Thurber did a tremendous job of writing and directing \u0027Red Notice\u0027 that attracted two of the biggest stars in the world, in Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, and a dude who\u0027s only famous for his tattoos, raised eyebrow and a fanny pack. But dumb jokes aside, it\u0027s a monumental achievement for our Seven Bucks Productions to produce the most watched Netflix film of all time. \u0027Red Notice\u0027 was my first film on a streaming platform so it was critically important for myself and our Seven Bucks Company to deliver and move the streaming needle. What a holy s*** achievement and congrats to everyone involved.\" Do you have a New Year\u0027s goal or resolution? \"To be honest, I usually don\u0027t have New Year\u0027s resolutions. I know I sound like an a**hole here but I\u0027m the guy who usually just does it throughout the year. Whatever change needs to happen, I\u0027ll get it done and move on. But this past year has been different. It\u0027s opened my eyes a bit more to real change that needs to my attention. Work flow, work stream, what and who in my life really need my attention, what truly should be getting me out of bed. I\u0027ve reached a point in my life this past year where I realized just how vital the idea and essence of time is; who and what gets my time these days. We don\u0027t get time back, so in 2022 and beyond, the people, the projects, the energy, the everything. Life. If it gets my time and gets me out of bed, then I\u0027ll go to sleep knowing it was worth it and it was all time wisely spent. Time is our greatest and most valuable currency.\"\u003c/p\u003e",

The loss sees the French club exit the Champions League at the last-16 stage for the first time since 2019, and piles the pressure on the Argentine tactician. Sporting director Leonardo said after the loss that the club would not “throw everything in the bin”.\r\nMauricio Pochettino said that his PSG side lost their two-legged Champions League tie against Real Madrid “in 10 minutes”.\r\nThe Paris club were 2-0 up on aggregate with 60 minutes of the second leg gone, but a rapid-fire Karim Benzema hat-trick swung the tie in the favour of Real, who would go on to win 3-1 on the night and 3-2 on aggregate.\r\nAnd Pochettino said post-match that the game turned on Benzema’s first goal, which came after a mistake from PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. \r\n\"The first goal completely changed the game,\" Pochettino said. \"For an hour, we were better than Real Madrid. The atmosphere changed in the stadium.\r\n\"We made some mistakes after that, we can\u0027t say we didn\u0027t. The worst feeling is that we were the better side, but we lost the tie in 10 minutes.\r\n\"PSG have been chasing the Champions League for a number of years now. I\u0027m really disappointed, upset - but these things can happen. The next few weeks are not going to be easy.\"",

    "text": "New York (CNN Business)\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" — the latest movie in the Marvel franchise — crossed $1 billion at the global box office, the film\u0027s studio Sony (SNE) said on Sunday.\r\nThe film reached the milestone just 12 days after it was released. Only 2019\u0027s \"Avengers: Endgame\" and \"Avengers: Infinity War\" reached that mark in less time, at 5 days and 11 days, respectively.\r\nThe film has made $1.05 billion worldwide so far.\r\n\r\n\"No Way Home\" — which stars Tom Holland and Zendaya as Peter Parker and MJ as they battle villains from across the Marvel multiverse — is also the only film of the pandemic era to make $1 billion worldwide.\r\n\r\nIt is the first film to reach $1 billion since \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,\" which was released in December 2019. Sony also said that \"No Way Home\" is now the top grossing film of the year worldwide.\r\nThe film — which was made by Sony and Disney\u0027s Marvel Studios — has had an amazing run at the box office, especially since the world is still in the midst of a pandemic.\r\n\r\n\"No Way Home\" notched a record-breaking opening weekend at the North American box office last weekend when it brought in $260 million. That was the second largest domestic opening of all time. That opening was also the best ever for each of the month of December, the Spider-Man franchise and Sony Pictures.\r\n\r\n\"What this represents is quite mind-boggling,\" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business. \"These numbers would be very impressive in the pre-pandemic era, but for \u0027Spider-Man: No Way Home\u0027 to sprint to a billion dollars in this marketplace is really hard to wrap your mind around.\"\r\n\"The monumental achievement of \u0027No Way Home\u0027 hitting this number cannot be overstated for this industry right now,\" he added.",

A lotta people are gonna haaaaaaaate,\" VanDerWerff tweeted. \"My favorite kind of movie!!\"\r\n\r\nYahoo Entertainment writer Ethan Alter tweeted \"Absolutely adored which builds on where the sequels left off in beautiful and unexpected ways, and presents a world that\u0027s entirely consistent with what came before and also opens it up to a host of new stories. My synapses have been firing for days.\"\r\nIt wasn\u0027t all roses however.\r\n\"#TheMatrixResurrections is an almost 2.5-hour exposition dump with choppy action scenes reminiscent of the Bourne movies,\" critic Jeff Nelson tweeted. \"It reuses far too much footage from previous installments and is meta to a fault.\"\r\nThe fourth in the Matrix franchise, the film reunites stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss who reprise their roles as Neo and Trinity.\r\n",
