This is my final project for the Spring Advanced course in SoftUni. 
It is based on MVC structure. Using Spring Framework, MySQL as database, Thymeleaf template engine, Responsive Web Page Design based on Bootstrap, Cloudinary to store images, TinyMCE: "What you see is what you get" HTML Editor.
The project is also based on a list of requirements that are detailly described below with some examples of how they're implemented.
The same project without the Unit/Integration tests is deployed on Heroku with imported data where you can get an idea of the application.


## Features
DailyNail is a news website with articles spread over different categories and subcategories.
It offers different sets of views and fully implemented management functionality. The main functionality is centered around creation, editing and posting of articles, daily jokes, setting of date and time when the drafted articles should appear on the website, if they should be in the top panel, should their comments be disabled and other options, regulating comments etc. The application also gathers data of the users' preferences by view count of different categories of articles. It offers accounts role management by the admin. The entity data can and is regurarly exported to json files and can be imported in case of need or on empty database.

## General Requirements

Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks, and development techniques:


•	The application must be implemented using Spring Framework.                                             ✓  
•	The application must have at least 12 web pages (views/components).                         ✓  
•	The application must have at least 5 independent entity models.                             ✓

•	The application must have at least 5 repositories. ✓ [Go to Project Structure](#structure) 

•	Use **Thymeleaf** template engine or make the Front-End using JavaScript, 			
consuming REST services from a Web API.                                                         ✓

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Using MySQL in the project and PostgreSQL in the demo deployed on Heroku.

•	Use Spring Data to access your database.                                                    ✓  
•	Use Hibernate or any other provider as a JPA implementation.                                ✓  

•	Implement Responsive Web Page Design based on Bootstrap / Google Material Design.           ✓  
•	Use the standard Spring Security for managing users and roles.                              ✓  
•	Your registered users should have at least these roles: user and administrator.             ✓  
•	User roles should be manageable from the application. ✓ [Go to Roles Management](#roles)
